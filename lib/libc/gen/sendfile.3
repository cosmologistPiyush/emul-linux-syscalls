.Dt SENDFILE 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sendfile
.Nd transfer data from a file to a socket inside the kernel space
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In splice.h
.Ft ssize_t
.Fo sendfile
.Fa "int fd"
.Fa "off_t *offset"
.Fa "int sockfd"
.Fa "size_t nbytes"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn sendfile
attempts to transfer
.Fa nbytes
of data from the object referenced by the descriptor
.Fa fd
to the socket descriptor, 
.Fa sockfd ,
without copying the data between the kernel and the user address space.
.Pp
The following semantics apply for the file descriptor and its offset:
.Pp
.Bl -hyphen -offset indent -compact
.It
If
.Fa offset
is NULL, then data is read starting from the file offset, and its
value keeps getting modified.
.It
However, if the offset is non\-NULL, data is read starting from the location
specified by the offset variale with future modifications to its value, and not
the value of the file offset.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn sendfile
call is just a wrapper that eventually invokes the
.Fn splice
system call for doing the actual transfer of data.
.\" More info about working of splice;
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful,
.Fn sendfile
returns the number of bytes moved from
.Fa fd
to
.Fa sockfd .
Otherwise, \-1 is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn sendfile
will succeed unless:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EAGAIN
The individual file descriptor
.Fa fd
or
.Fa sockfd
was marked for non-blocking I/O, and no data was ready to be read or written.
.It Bq Er EBADF
Either
.Fa fd
is not a valid descriptor open for reading or
.Fa sockfd
doesn't correspond to a socket descriptor.
.\" space for EFAULT if it is a possibility
.It Bq Er EINTR
A read or write from or to a slow device
(i.e. one that might block for an arbitrary amount of time)
was interrupted by the delivery of a signal
before any data arrived.
See
.Xr sigaction 2
for more information on the interaction between signals and system
calls.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
Either file pointer associated with
.Fa fd
or
.Fa sockfd
was negative; or
the total length of the I/O is more than can be expressed by the ssize_t
return value.
.It Bq Er EIO
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
.It Bq Er EISDIR
.Fa fd
refers to a directory.
